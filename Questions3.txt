No, not all consumers will be part of the same consumer group in a Kafka setup. Here's how consumer groups typically work:

Consumer Groups in Kafka:
A consumer group is a group of consumers that cooperate to consume messages from Kafka partitions. Consumers in the same group will not read the same message from the same partition, meaning each partition is consumed by only one consumer in the group. The key point here is that consumers within the same consumer group work together to consume messages, but they don't consume the same messages.
Scenario: Multiple Consumer Groups
In your case, there are 3 consumer groups. Each of these groups will have consumers, and each consumer group consumes messages independently of the others.

Let’s break it down:

Consumer Group 1:
It could have multiple consumers, and these consumers will share the partitions of the Kafka topic. If there are 10 partitions, and Group 1 has 5 consumers, the partitions will be distributed among them, with each partition being assigned to only one consumer in the group.
Consumer Group 2:

This group is separate from Group 1. Even if it has the same or different number of consumers, it will consume the same messages as Group 1 but in parallel. The consumers in this group will get their own assignments to the partitions, meaning they can consume messages from the same partitions that Group 1’s consumers are consuming from. However, the offset for each consumer group is maintained independently, so the consumers of Group 2 will consume messages from the beginning (or wherever the group’s offset is) regardless of where Group 1 is in its consumption.
Consumer Group 3:
Similarly, this group operates independently of both Group 1 and Group 2. It can have its own set of consumers, and they will also consume the same messages independently of the other groups, using their own offset management.

Key Points:
Different Consumer Groups = Different Message Consumption: Consumers in different groups will independently consume the messages. Kafka keeps track of each consumer group’s offset separately, so if a message has been consumed by one group, it is still available for other groups to consume.

Within the Same Consumer Group: If there are multiple consumers in a consumer group, they work together to share the partitions. Kafka ensures that each partition is consumed by only one consumer in a group.
Multiple Consumers per Group: If a consumer group has fewer consumers than partitions (e.g., 3 consumers, 10 partitions), some consumers will handle more than one partition, but still, each partition is consumed by only one consumer in the group.
Example:
Group 1 has 5 consumers. These 5 consumers will consume messages from all 10 partitions, with each consumer assigned to a subset of those partitions (depending on the partition assignment strategy used).
Group 2 has 3 consumers. These consumers will also consume messages from the same 10 partitions but independently of Group 1, and they’ll have their own set of offsets.
Group 3 has 2 consumers. They will consume from the same 10 partitions independently of Groups 1 and 2, with their own offset management.
Conclusion:
No, not all consumers will be part of the same consumer group. You can have multiple consumer groups, and each group can have multiple consumers, but the consumers within a group will share partition assignments. Consumers in different groups will independently consume messages from the same topic and partitions.

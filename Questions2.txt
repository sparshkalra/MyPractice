What is the difference between atomic and volatile keyword?

	Atomic variables are part of the java.util.concurrent.atomic package, and they are designed to handle atomic operations on variables in a thread-safe way without requiring synchronized blocks or locks.

	The volatile keyword in Java is used to indicate that a variable's value can be modified by multiple threads simultaneously. When a variable is marked as volatile, it tells the JVM and the compiler that the value of the variable can be changed at any time by different threads, and thus the value should not be cached or optimized by the compiler.
